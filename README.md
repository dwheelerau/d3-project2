# d3-project2
Do a scatter plot to look at the relationship between temp and due point. The checklist we can use for all charts is:  

1. Access the data - look at data structures  
2. Create chart dims - pixes of space for chart  
3. Draw canvas - render the chart area and bounds element  
4. Create the scales  
5. Draw the data elements  
6. Draw peripherals - axis, labels, legend  
7. Setup interactions - event listeners (not done here)
